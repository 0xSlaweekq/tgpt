curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aandrew-me/tgpt/main/install | bash -s /usr/local/bin
\`\`\`

If you are using Arch Linux, you can install with pacman:

\`\`\`bash
pacman -S tgpt
\`\`\`


### FreeBSD üòà 

To install the [port](https://www.freshports.org/www/tgpt):
\`\`\`
cd /usr/ports/www/tgpt/ && make install clean
\`\`\`
To install the package, run one of these commands:
\`\`\`
pkg install www/tgpt
pkg install tgpt
\`\`\`

### Install with Go
You need to [add the Go install directory to your system's shell path](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/compile-install). 

\`\`\`bash
go install github.com/aandrew-me/tgpt/v2@latest
\`\`\`

### Windows ü™ü

## Updating ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
If you installed the program with the installation script, you may update it with
\`\`\`bash

\`\`\`
**It may require admin privileges.**

- Socks5 Proxy [ \`socks5://ip:port ]\`
- Socks5 Auth [ \`socks5://user:pass@ip:port\` ]

If you want to use a proxy, create \`proxy.txt\` file in the same directory from where you are executing the file and write your proxy configuration there.

\`\`\`bash
http://127.0.0.1:8080
\`\`\`

### From Release

You can download the executable for your operating system, rename it to \`tgpt\` (or any other desired name), and then execute it by typing \`./tgpt\` while in that directory. Alternatively, you can add it to your PATH environmental variable and then execute it by simply typing \`tgpt\`.


## Uninstalling
If you installed with the install script, you can execute the following command to remove the tgpt executable
